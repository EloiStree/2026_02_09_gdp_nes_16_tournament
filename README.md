# NES 16 tournament

> I had an idea 😉

I have 16 inexpensive NES gamepads and 4 mini computers that I use to teach kids and students how to code.
If those 16 NES controllers are routed through my Xbox emulator, **XOMI**, it becomes possible to organize small tournaments. Think pools of 16 players split into four simultaneous matches.

This Godot package would make that setup possible by redirecting NES controller input to the four computers using [XOMI](https://github.com/EloiStree/XOMI) and [S2W](https://github.com/EloiStree/S2W).
